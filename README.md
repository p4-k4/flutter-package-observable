## Introduction 📘

The Observable Dart package is a state management solution tailored for Flutter applications. It enables efficient and flexible handling of state changes.

- **Generic Observable**: Core class `Observable<T>` to track and notify state changes.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Methods for asynchronous initialization and updates.
- **Observer and Watcher Patterns**: Facilitates state subscriptions for widgets and functions.

- **Flutter Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Flutter's UI components.
